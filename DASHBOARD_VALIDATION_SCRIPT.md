# Expected: {"status":"ok","uptime":...,"googleOAuth":{...}}
```

**Authentication Required Endpoints:**
```bash
# Test without token (should fail)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/appointments
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Test with valid token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <valid-jwt-token>" http://localhost:3001/api/appointments
# Expected: Array of appointments or empty array
```

**Role-Based Access:**
```bash
# Test patient access to appointments
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <patient-token>" http://localhost:3001/api/appointments
# Expected: Patient's own appointments only

# Test doctor access to patients
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <doctor-token>" http://localhost:3001/api/patients
# Expected: All patients
